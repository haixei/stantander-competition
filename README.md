# Santander Customer Transactions

The data set used comes from a past Kaggle competition that had as its goal to tackle the problem of creating a prediction model for customer transaction. In this repository I'm going to work with anonymous data that often appears in the industry, provide a direction on how to use it and in the end, create accurate model able to make a decision on if the customer will make a transaction in the future. Data analysis is a very important part of the financial industry and constantly improves the quality of the service banks offer.
